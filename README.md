#Playgrounds
### simulatorBasePlayground
base playground running in the simulator.
Really useful to prototype code that use user interaction (like gestures), otherwise impossible in the playground itself.

To run the simulator press alt-cmd-0 and select 
[V] run in full simulator

if it dosn't start automatically just edit anything the code (adding a space) 

### simulatorButtonAnimated
playground running in simulator with an uibutton having a ridimensioning and color changing animation, that appens when touched.
